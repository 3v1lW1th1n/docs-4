# [AppSeed Docs](https://docs.appseed.us)

The official documentation repo for all web apps and boilerplate code 

<br />

## How to build the docs

The project uses [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the HTMl pages from Makrdown files. To build locally the project, Nodejs must be installed. 

```bash
$ # Clone Sources
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/docs.git
$ cd docs
$
$ # Install modules
$ yarn 
$
$ # Start the app
$ yarn start
$
$ # Please visit http://localhost:8000 in browser
```

## How to contribute

Each page provides a *Edit on github* button in the top bar (see below). By clicking on it, the user is redirected on github and invited to fork, edit the page and make a pull request to notify the owner that the content is updated.
