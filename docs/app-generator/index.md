title: Full-Stack App Generator

# Quick Start
Build React, Vue.js Full-Stack Apps integrated with Express, Laravel, Flask backends in no-time.

A developer can get a Full-Stack app in many ways: using the [app generator](https://appseed.us/fullstack-apps-generator), check the latest starters from our official [Github repo](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/README.md) or using **Yeoman**. 
Theoretically, all of them are providing the same stuff, but the **app generator will perform supplementary checks and tests**, making the delivery **100% stable**.  

<br />

## Using App Generator (recommended)
---
**Note:** `The generator can be used by developers, without an account.`

* Access the [app generator](https://appseed.us/app-generator) page
* Select the frontend engine. You can choose from **Vue.js** and **React**
* Select the preferred backend. You can choose from **Expres**, **Laravel** and **Flask**
* **Confirm**. After performing a few tests the **deliverables** (backend.zip, frontend.zip) are sent to your email adress.  

<br />

## Using Github Starters
---
**Note:** `The repo can contain untested code.`

* Access the official [Github repo](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/README.md)
* Checkout the preferred backend: [Express](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/starter-express/README.md), [Laravel](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/starter-laravel/README.md) or [Flask](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/starter-flask/README.md)
* Choose a frontend UI KIT: [Vue.js](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/starter-vue/argon-design-system/README.md) or [React](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/starter-react/material-kit/README.md)
* `Please` Follow the instructions saved in `README` files. 

**Note:** `In case of any issue, please open a fault on @Github. We will provide a fix asap.`

## Using Yeoman

The official [Yeoman AppSeep wrapper](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/generator-fullstack-apps)

* Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-fullstack-apps using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-fullstack-apps
```

* Then generate your new project (follow the installer steps):

```bash
yo fullstack-apps
