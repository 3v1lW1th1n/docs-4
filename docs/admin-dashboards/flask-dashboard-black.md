## [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) (for newcomers)
---

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) ([source code](https://github.com/pallets/flask)) is a Python web framework built with a small core and modularity in mind. With a small footprint, well documented and supported by a growing community, Flask can be a good choice to implement on top a nice production-ready Admin Dashboard.

### Setup the environment
In order to use the boilerplates, we need Python and Flask installed on the workstation. The Python can be downloaded from the official website and Flask can be easily added using PIP command:

```bash

$ # Test the Python install 
$ python --version
$ Python 3.7.2

$ # install Flask using PIP
$ pip install Flask

```

<br />

## Build from sources
---

```bash
$ # clone the sources
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-black-dashboard.git
$ cd flask-black-dashboard
$
$ # install modules using a virtualenv
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
$
$ python app.py
$ # app is running on port 5000
```
