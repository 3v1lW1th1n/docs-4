# Setup Pyhton
This article, part of the **[Flask - learn by coding](/tutorials/flask-learn-by-coding/index.md)** tutorial, describes hot to setup the environment to run a basic Flask application. To start coding a web applications in Flask, we need only two things:

<br />

## Install Python
---
[Pyhton](https://www.python.org) can be installed on all well known operating systems from this [page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Select the installer for your operating system, and exex the installer. 
To check the instalation, type in `python --version` your preferred terminal. If Pyhton is properly installed, you should be able to visualize the version:

```
$ python --version
Python 3.7.2
```

<br />

## Install Flask
---
To install Flask, use [PIP command](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp) to install Flask:

```
$ pip install Flask 
$ pip freeze | grep Flask 
```
At this point, you should have a running Flask environment.
